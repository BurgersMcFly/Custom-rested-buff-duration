# Custom Rested Buff Duration

Rested buff (increased xp gain when sleeping) lasts for longer. Can choose between 3 IRL hours (24 in-game hours), 6 IRL hours, 9 IRL or 12 IRL hours.

The timer won't show the full 3/6/9/12 hours countdown but it will reset after every hour. It looks like this:

Credits to [CrazySD](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/users/35969520) for doing it first with Redmod with their [Better Housing Buffs](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/6181) mod. Make sure to download and endorse their mod. You don't need it for this to work but you can use both at the same time.
